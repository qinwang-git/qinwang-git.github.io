    I am a <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Academic_ranks_(Australia_and_New_Zealand)" target="_blank"> senior research scientist </a> at <a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/research/technology-space" target="_blank">CSIRO Data61</a> and an adjunct lecturer at University of New South Wales (<a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/qin-wang" target="_blank">UNSW</a>) and University of Technology Sydney (<a href="http://159.196.157.153:8000/" target="_blank">UTS</a>). Before that, I had my PhD career at Swinburne University of Technology.
    Previously, I received my Master’s degree from Beihang University (BUAA) and Bachelor’s degree from Northwestern Polytechnical Univerisity (NPU).
    

<br>
<br> My research centres on trustworthy distributed computation — how to make large-scale, decentralized systems secure, privacy-preserving, and incentive-compatible.
I approach these problems through decentralized techniques (primarily blockchain), and extend the same principles to collaborative learning (e.g., split learning) and LLM-enabled systems (e.g., agentic collaboration), where security, robustness, and accountability become first-class design constraints. 

<br>
<br> Blockchain (yah, love it!)
<br> - token-related（e.g., -omics, -ization) 
<br> - Layer2 Protocols (e.g, DApps, govenernance) 
<br> - Layer1 Protocols (e.g, consensus, incentives) 

<br> 
<br> Distributed computation
<br> - privacy-preserving distributed learning (e.g., split/federated/unlearning)
<br> - trustworthy collaborative systems (e.g., agentic collaboration)
